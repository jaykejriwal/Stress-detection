# Stress detection using non-semantic speech representation

Stress detection with Slovak dataset using different speech features. In this paper, we sought to build a deep learning model that would accurately classify the stress levels of Slovak speakers from acted speech corpus.

## Usage

Four Jupyter Notebook files are provided. Each file presents a step-by-step procedure for extracting MFCC, PLP, TRILL, and vector features and training the model.
